  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
  Transformers are robots that can transform into various kinds of vehicles,
  like cars, planes and helicopters.<br>
  The overall aim of this entire assignment is to create a short Film with
  a tansformer of your own design. In this part of the assignment we
  model the transformer. The report contains brief description of various concepts used in creation
  of the model.

<h2>The Vehicle</h2>

  
<p>
  Controls have been added to move the vehicle appropriately.<br>
  1. <b>Up arrow</b> - move the vehicle forward.<br>
  2. <b>Down arrow</b> - move the vehicle in reverse direction.<br>
  3. <b>Left arrow</b> - turn the vehicle left (while the up arrow is pressed)<br>
  4. <b>Right arrow</b> - turn the vehicle right (while the up arrow is pressed)<br>
  5. <b>5</b> - Record Mode on, After turning this mode on, we can capture keyframes<br>
  6. <b>P</b> - On pressing this keyframes get recorded into a file named keyframes.txt<br>
  7. <b>2</b> - Play the recorded keyframes<br>
  8. <b>3</b> - While play mode is on, on pressing this button pictures will get stored into a folder named frames<br>


<h2>Linear Interpolation</h2>

<p>
  We have used linear interpolation to generate frames in between keyframes, both for angles and position.
For lights we have used the following protocol: If the light is off in one keyframe and on in the next, 
then in the first half of the frames it is off and in the second half it is on. <br><br>
<b>Controls</b><br>
1. <b>8</b> - Turns the first light on/off.<br>
2. <b>9</b> - Turns the second light on/off.<br>
3. <b>7</b> - Turns the headlight on/off.<br>

<h2>Linux commands and tools used to create the movie</h2>
<em>mogrify -flip -format jpg -quality 100 frame_*.ppm</em>
- This command is run in the folder where the images have been stored. It flips the images 
vertically.
<br>
<em>ffmpeg -framerate 60 -i frame_%04d.jpg -codec copy input.mkv</em>
- This command creates the movie from the jpg images<br>
<em>
<em>ffmpeg -i input.mkv -i final_track.mp3 -c copy -map 0:0 -map 1:0 output2.mkv
</em>- This command adds sound track to the movie<br>

<h2>Camera</h2>
Numpad keys 8,4,6,and 2 have been used to move the camera around the scene.
