==============================

###About###
Transformers are robots that can transform into various kinds of vehicles, like cars, planes and helicopters.
This is a modelling of Bumblebee transformer.

###Controls###
####Selection####
**Tab** toggles the selection between multiple bots.<br>

*After selecting a particular bot:*<br>
*Button -> part* mapping:<br>
**Spacebar** -> body of the transformer (so that it can move as a whole)<br>
**H** -> torso<br>
**G** -> right thigh<br>
**J** -> left thigh<br>
**B** -> right leg<br>
**N** -> left leg<br>

####Rotation####
*After selecting a the body or a particular part:*<br>
*Depending on the degree of freedom of the part:*<br><br>
Assuming that the body's axes are always such that:<br>
Y-axis is always aligned along the torso towards the neck.<br>
X-axis is along the hip, from left to right.<br>
Z-axis is towards the outward normal from the front portion of the hip<br><br>
**Q** -> rotates it about Z-axis<br>
**W** -> rotates it about X-axis<br>
**A** -> rotates it about Y-axis<br>
<br>
####Transformation####
**UP** arrow key will transform the bot to vehicle and it will bring car back to bot.<br>
